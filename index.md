# Assignment #1: Bind TCP Shell
Create a shell_bind_tcp shellcode that binds to a port and execute a shell on an incoming connection, the port number should be easy to configure.

## Context

Have you ever generated shellcode with tools like Metasploit and MSFvenom? 
If you have, I'm sure you've wondered what that shellcode actually translates to beyond the generic descriptor "linux/x86/shell_bind_tcp".

I'm going to teach you how to not only read shellcode, but create your own as well.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of registers
- Basic understanding of stack and memory
- An interest in the subject

## Approach

There are dozens of approaches you could take to create shellcode, but before we create it, we first need to need to understand how it works. 
To better understand what's happening, we're going to reverse enginner and analyze it.

## Was that supposed to mean anything?

Now if you're not experienced with assembly I'm sure your very confused right now. That's alright though, we're going to learn what all this means.
Let's start from the top, where the first "int 0x80" instruction is passed. This is known as a syscall instruction, it let's the processor know to interpret the current registers as such.

## Syscalls

Moving up 1 position, we see the instruction "mov al,0x66". 0x66 converted to Hex is 102. Every syscall has an integer assigned to it so it can be identified and processed as it's specific function. If we inspect "/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/asm/unistd_32.h" we can see syscall (102) points to "socketcall".

```
#define __NR_socketcall         102
#define __NR_syslog             103
#define __NR_setitimer          104
#define __NR_getitimer          105
#define __NR_stat               106
#define __NR_lstat              107
#define __NR_fstat              108
#define __NR_olduname           109
#define __NR_iopl               110
#define __NR_vhangup            111
#define __NR_idle               112
#define __NR_vm86old            113
```

## What is socketcall? 

Well put simply, it's a common kernel entry point for socket system calls. If we read the documentation [here](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketcall.2.html) we can see it takes 2 parameters: socketcall(int call, unsigned long *args). 
This is important to know because when we call this syscall we'll need to invoke it correctly. 

If we read the documentation we can see it takes the socket function as the first parameter, this means that it's deciding how to invoke it. The first argument that would be passed

Let's keep a note of everything we now known about this syscall and move on.

## Syscalls in the shellcode

If you go through the shellcode you'll see 6 syscalls happening. If you were to analyze how each function works along with their parameters, well it would take a long time. So I've saved you the trouble and compiled a list of each syscall being invoked in order of when they appear.

1. socketcall(SYS_SOCKET, (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0))
2. socketcalll(SYS_BIND,(ADDRESS-SYS_SOCKET-SOCKFD,ADDRESS-SYS_SOCKET-STRUCT,len(16),4444))
3. socketcall(SYS_LISTEN, sockfd)
4. socketcall(SYS_ACCEPT, (sockfd)
5. dup2(acceptFD, (0x2,0x1,0x0))
6. execve(/bin//sh0x00)

Now I encourage you to actually go through the documentation of each so you have a fundamental understanding of what's actually happening.
You can find the documentation for each below:

1. https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketcall.2.html
2. https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html
3. https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listen.2.html
4. https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/accept.2.html
5. https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html

If you're just looking for a quick and dirty explanation I've got you covered too.

1. socketcall(SYS_SOCKET) creates a kernel entry point for socket system calls
2. socketcall(SYS_BIND) assigns an address to a socket referred to by the sockfd file descriptor
3. socketcall(SYS_LISTEN) marks the socket as passive, meaning it will be used to accept incoming connection requests using accept().
4. socketcall(SYS_ACCEPT) extracts the connection request for the listening socket and creates a new connected socket. The newly created socket is not in the listening state.
5. dup2(acceptFD,*) creates a copy of the file descriptor and uses the new specified file descriptor
6. execve(/bin//sh0x00) executes the program referred to by pathname. Which in this case is "/bin//sh"
